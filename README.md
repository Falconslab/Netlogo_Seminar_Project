# Netlogo_Shipping_Lines

This repository contains the project for the Agent-based Modeling course at Ruhr University Bochum. The project focuses on the economic impact of a blockade of a container shipping route.

## Overview

In this project, we use the NetLogo modeling environment to simulate the effects of a blockade on a container shipping route. The simulation models the behavior of multiple shipping companies and their vessels navigating through a network of ports and shipping lanes. By introducing a blockade scenario, we can analyze the economic consequences, such as delays, increased transportation costs, and supply chain disruptions.

The simulation takes into account various factors, including vessel capacity, shipping demand, port capacities, and route selection strategies. By running different scenarios and tweaking parameters, we can explore how different blockade scenarios affect the overall efficiency and economic performance of the shipping industry.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains the NetLogo model files used for the simulation.
- `data/`: Includes any relevant data files used in the simulation, such as port capacities, shipping demand data, or blockade scenarios.
- `results/`: Stores the output and analysis results generated from running the simulations.
- `docs/`: Contains additional documentation, including research papers, technical specifications, or explanatory materials.
- `src/`: Contains any additional source code or scripts used in the project.
- `README.md`: This README file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the simulations.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:


        git clone https://github.com/your-username/Netlogo_Shipping_Lines.git

  Install NetLogo: Make sure you have NetLogo installed on your machine. You can download NetLogo from the official website: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

  Open NetLogo: Launch the NetLogo application.

  Open the simulation model: Navigate to the models/ directory and open the NetLogo model file (shipping_lines.nlogo) using NetLogo.

  Configure parameters: Adjust the simulation parameters according to the desired blockade scenario or experiment settings.

  Run the simulation: Click on the "Run" button in the NetLogo interface to start the simulation.

  Analyze the results: After the simulation finishes, analyze the output data and generated results located in the results/ directory.
